<h1>Bootply Bootstrap Playground</h1>
  Bootply is a playground for Twitter Bootstrap. Bootply helps you design, prototype, extend, build and test the Bootstrap framework.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
  You can use Bootply to edit HTML, JavaScript and CSS code that utilizes the Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks. To create a new project (known as a "ply"), simply type code in either the HTML, JavaScript or CSS code editors. Code in any of these
  is completely optional, but there must be code in a least one in order to save the ply.
